# CodeLibrary
This repository (written in Python and C++) contains various examples, implementation of algorithms, solution to standard/non-standard problems and whatever code I find useful and worth archiving.</br>

## Build status : 
Under development.</br>

## Sub-folder description :
### Solutions_ProjectEuler :
This folder contains solutions to some selected problem statements from www.projecteuler.net implemented in C++/Python.</br>
PS: In future, I might provide solutions to all the problem statements in both C++ and Python. Also, feel free to collaborate (in any language).
